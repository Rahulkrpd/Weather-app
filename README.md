# React + Vite



# Weather Forecast Application

This is a Weather Forecast Application built with React.js. It fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast for a selected city. The app also allows users to search for weather information in different cities, switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit, and view detailed weather conditions.

## Features

- **Current Weather Display**: Displays weather data including temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed for a default city (e.g., New York).
- **City Search**: Users can search for weather information by city name. The search results provide real-time weather data for the queried city.
- **5-Day Forecast**: Below the current weather, a 5-day forecast is displayed with the temperature highs, lows, and weather icons.
- **Temperature Unit Conversion**: Allows users to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles errors such as city not found or network issues, displaying appropriate messages.
